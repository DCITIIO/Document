  ## Abstract

<center>DCiti is a blockchain protocol on the EOSIO software that can be deployed to provide decentralized and blockchain based operating system to new and existing smart cities that want to operate a crypto based economy. DCiti opens up opportunity for decentralized smart solutions to be offered to smart city residents. Our blockchain solution can be utilized to create a connection between the physical infrastructures of a smart city and open distributed ledger technology.
  
We developed a system that can be used in the planning, building and administration of smart city with a totally new and different experience, all made possible with an all-in-one blockchain protocol. Developers are provided with an easy access to building cutting edge smart service DApps, while Smart Cities and her residents are provided with an easy opportunity for fundraising for the development of city projects through token offering, and leaders of smart cities are provided with the opportunity to offer secure and transparent governance to residents.

DCiti is our solution to the nascent smart city and free community space that we believe is due for an entirely new operating system, which we believe can be best made possible through decentralization, powered by shared contributions and ownership between all parties involved (government, investors and residents) in the building of the community.

We propose a flexible and scalable blockchain protocol that can power smart cities and free communities with a user token effect which can provide funding for the development of smart city projects, offer inclusiveness of residents in participation and the development of the cities they want to live in, which creates an attitude of “by all and for all” in response to the fast moving world of decentralization.</center>

## Mission Statement

To be a Decentralized Operating System (DOS) that connect smart cities and free communities to blockchain and make positive changes happen in the best smart cities and free communities of the world.


## Introduction

Every industry is about to be disrupted by the decentralization era via a great technology evolution led by blockchain technology. Some industries are already disrupted and many are being threatened. Among others that are yet to feel the maximal impact of blockchain technology is the nascent industry of smart city.

There are numerous announcement of smart city projects across the globe in the year 2017, followed by massive interest and partnership from big brands like Google, Microsoft, Verizon, Nokia and Ericsson. Yet, this is just the beginning of something big, about to take place in both the blockchain tech and smart city industry. We woke up early to the reality of smart cities, an industry forecasted to have a $1.2 trillion market by 2022.

The switch in the last couple of years in Urbanism from building traditional cities from scratch to building smart cities and turning existing traditional cities into smart cities was a product of technological advancement, many of it that carter for the growing population of urban areas and provide better solutions to the growing needs of city residents.
DCiti is the easy answer for blockchain implementation into smart cities, our project is leading a revolutionary movement in both industries that will see through how blockchain technology can help augment the success, adoption and administration of smart cities around the world.

Statistics are that 60% of the worldwide population will live by 2020 in cities and these will account for 75% of energy consumption and 80% of greenhouse gases. Therefore more smart cities are being built all over the world from scratch to cater for this urban increasing population.

While smart cities serve as a better way to make our cities and her residents smarter and live better through the implementation of Information and Communication Technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), sensor and wireless network, and data analysis.

We believe that by introducing blockchain technology through DCiti, we can offer a better and easy way for existing and new smart cities to adopt the world of blockchain technology to build smart cities that can be efficiently and transparently govern, connect different city services to a decentralized data grid, initiate the collaborative and gift economy, provide fundraising opportunities to smart cities private developers, and make living in a smart city rewarding, and self sustaining.

## BitCiti Smart City

BlockBit1, the management company developing DCiti blockchain will be building the first decentralized smart city from scratch called BitCiti. The development of this city is aimed at redefining the rules of urban development and providing a new operating system by using emerging technologies such as blockchain to lay out new structures of how future smart cities can be better built and operated with efficient and equal distribution of advantage among residents and leaders of a particular city.

With BitCiti Smart City and DCiti Blockchain, we are effectively combining the concept of smart city with the technology of blockchain to create a loving and a livable city experience for cryptocurrency enthusiasts, technology lovers and adventurous tourists that love to explore new and amazing things.
We believe smart cities have the potential to transform our lives, support more inclusive, safe and resilient cities and can foster open innovation but only if the digital transformation is open and decentralized. Open and distributed innovation, encourages user innovation. Such innovation allows for user participation and increases the welfare and community experience.

While DCiti is the world’s first all-in-one blockchain protocol bridging the gap between smart technologies such as Internet of Things, Sensor, wireless network Tech, and blockchain to provide decentralized services to existing and new smart cities project all over the world, BitCiti will be our first practical test of a decentralized smart city and free community built with 100% decentralized system, operating a crypto based economy and using DCiti blockchain.

Our decentralized service approach to smart city has the potential to change the way most of the world’s cities and her citizens get introduced with blockchain technology and use cryptocurrency in a new and exciting way that wasn’t possible before now. This paper provides fundamental details of how DCiti and BitCiti will lead in the revolution of traditional and smart city to be self dependent and favorable to every party involved in the city through crypto shared Allocation

## The Evolution of Smart City

Cities can’t survive without her residents, and her residents are a growing group of people with constant needs that rely on their cities to get meet. Efforts to fulfill the many needs of these residents became the bedrock for adoptions of emerging technologies in cities that brought about the current evolution of smart city.

The concept of smart city has been introduced to highlight the importance of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in the last 20 years (Schaffers, 2012) Today, almost every cities are looking into ways they can implement smart solutions into their neighborhood for accurate predictions of the residents daily routine and behavior to the environment. Many of the leading big cities in the world want to lead in this new economic system and even successful entrepreneurs like Bill Gates are throwing in millions of dollars into helping smart city projects achieve their smart solution goals.

The evolution of cities in the twentieth century was dictated by modernization and the application of technology. Twenty first century cities are evolving according to their ability to assimilate intelligence based on the emerging concept of the smart city. The term smart city has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. Since the end of last century, many cities have initiated smart city initiatives.

## What Is A Smart City?

Sensor networks form the basis of the smart city. They collect information to be stored and analyzed in order to improve services. The term smart city still remain unclear and has no universally agreed upon definition, experts across the world seem to have different definition and interpretation for it, such as;
A smart city is an urban area that uses different types of electronic data collection sensors to supply information used to manage assets and resources efficiently.[Matt Hamblen 2015]
Smart city is a high tech intensive and advanced city that connect people, information and city element using technologies in order to create a sustainable, greener city competitive and innovative commerce, and an increased life quality. [Bakici et al 2012]
A useful definition to start to call a city “smart” is when “investment in human and social capital and traditional (transportation) and modern (ICT) infrastructure, fuel sustainable economic growth and high quality of life, with a wise management of natural resources, through participatory government” (Caragliu, 2009)
A city that monitors and integrates conditions of all of its critical infrastructure - including roads, bridges, tunnels, rails, subways, airports, seaports, communications, water, power, even major buildings - can better optimize its resources, plan its preventive maintenance activities and monitor security aspects while maximizing services to its citizens. [US Office Technical and Scientific Information]
A smart city uses information, and communications technology to enhance its livability, workability and sustainability. [Smart Cities Council 2014]

## What Does A Smart City Look Like?

What does a “smart” city look like? Having a good example of one we believe will help many people get familiarized with this concept and the best example we found is Barcelona, a city bestowed with the title of “World’s Smartest City” — by British market research firm Juniper Research in 2015. The city, which has a population of more than 1.6 million, has implemented a program that is already successfully supporting the local public transportation system and the use of electric vehicles.

There are now 500 hybrid taxis on the streets of Barcelona, as well as nearly 300 public electric vehicles and an estimated 400 private electric cars. The program also calls for the intelligent networking of energy and water supplies and lighting and mobility systems in order to improve the quality of life and protect the environment. In addition, the city has implemented open-government measures to improve the transparency and availability of its administrative agencies.

## Blockchain Solution for Smart City

We discovered and share more practical ways we believe the blockchain in general can be used in providing the best solution to the crucial technical aspect of smart cities that relate to the use of the Internet and also favors all parties involved in the building of smart city. Our use cases page discussed other different solution that DCiti blockchain can be specifically applied in the development of better smart cities.

### Decentralized City Data Grid
Smart Cities are made up of different smart services that connect one infrastructure to another different system and therefore can be sometimes called system of systems. Internet of Things is playing a bigger role in data storage collected by sensors that can be accessed by anyone, but by means of centralized software tools.
This data helps provide proper understanding of the environmental conditions and the behavior of the residents to the environment. However, data stored on this cloud computing servers don’t have the best security measure taken and can be prone to cyber attacks that get them exposed which in turn can cause economic and social losses for smart cities. The more centralized communication networks, electricity and power generation and distribution are, the more vulnerable a city is to sabotage, cyber attacks, and physical interference.
The solution blockchain could offer to this is a decentralized city data system that is open and secured, and foster interaction between various smart system, smart residents and smart administrative relate which each other to work together as a single entity and adapt to the new direction of decentralization.
Developers can build Dapps to be integrated with Internet of Things to make the collection of accurate data easily possible and assembled on a decentralized distributed network of computers. The actual purpose of DCiti system is to be the decentralized data grid distributed across networks of computers that makes all other Dapps and smart contract system to function maximally.

### Trustless Shared Data Economy
Cities all over the world are opened to the concept of shared economy where individuals can rent or borrow goods and services rather than buy or own them. A good example is Airbnb, Uber and other internet service shared platform where a variety of things like time, cars, rides, knowledge could be shared. Since with the blockchain, there’s no monopoly of data by a single company, what if the data are open up for sharing? You can share data like you share your spare space at home and get incentive to do so.
A smart city is built around data where there are lots of sensors and device data (supply) and then companies, institution and individuals that want to create or access the new service (demand)
DCiti is providing a blockchain that allows for trustless sharing of data on fair terms. Data owners do not need to trust the counter-party when they share data. And shared data can be effectively tokenized and be assured that the value chain is maintained effectively.

### Cryptocurrency Based Economy
Before now cryptocurrencies are majorly used as either a digital form of exchange of value or as a utility token within an ecosystem. A good example of both scenarios is bitcoin and its alternative coin like litecoin which are a digital version of fiat currency and their major purpose is to be a peer to peer exchange of value online while a good example of utility token is steem token used in the steem blockchain network as a token for incentivizing the community, funding of community project and also peer to peer exchange of value within and outside the community.
The DCiti blockchain is bringing an opportunity for different smart cities to be able to operate a crypto based economy by issuing their city native cryptocurrency that might not only serve as utility token within the digital network of the community, but can also become a generally accepted currency within the physical community which serve the purpose as a major form of exchange of value instead of the government issued currency of the country. A good implementation of this concept is what we want to do with BitCiti Smart City. Where our smart city will operate its own native currency (cryptocurrency) that will be used for general purpose transaction within the city.
This gives freedom back to the people that actually deserves it and makes the crypto economy system effective while presenting the city as a valuable asset.

## Fundamental of DCiti

After evaluating what the needs and major problems of smart cities are, we are building our protocol on the fundamentals of security, trust, and identity. We believe that these are what makes a blockchain solution compatible with smart city.

### Security
Centralized networks can easily be attacked, shut down and manipulated by hackers through a simple detected loophole. Our blockchain solution provides adequate security through cryptography, that decentralized and distribute data and transaction across peer-to-peer networks that are continually updated and kept in sync. Our system Break up data into chunks, Encrypt the data so that you are the only one with access to it. Distribute files across a network in a way that means all your files are available, even if part of the network is down.
### Trust
Trust is a fundamental currency of relationship and the value chain in cities, different people with different background and belief come together to become neighbor to share the same environment must find a way to get the trust currency. With a tech like blockchain; transparency, distribution and traceability are core features that create trust. With DCiti trust is achieved through massive collaboration of both the digital community and the physical city residents who are interested in the growth of the system and actively participating in the best interest of the system because they are the system as the system is theirs too.

### Identity
With decentralized technology, we believe that we can simplify residents access to smart services and application through a distributed digital identity system that give power over own identity back to individuals. This creates a system that doesn’t require residents to prove they are who they said they are each time they need to access a smart service. DCiti applies a distributed network approach to building a secure and trusted identity system for residents to have access to smart services with maximal privacy and trust. With our approach, residents get to chose what companies view their digital identity, why they did, when they did, and how they plan using it. With this it becomes easy for resident identity to be verified and proven with identity fraud out of the equation, service provider also need not to worry about the accuracy of the data identity.

## Technology Architecture

DCiti is building it blockchain on EOSIO software developed by block.one company, because we believe that the technical requirement for our type of project use cases can only be met by a high performance based and self governing blockchain infrastructure that provide both horizontal and linear scaling of distributed technology application that can be adopted on a large scale which create room for multi purpose use of the blockchain in real life scenario.

### EOS
Eos has been described as the most powerful infrastructure for decentralized applications, it has also been seen as a brilliant solution to the industry wide challenge of scalability in distributed ledger technology which has become a fact in existing blockchain protocols. The concept of EOSIO providing a large scale, high performance blockchain solution has already been proven to a large extent in Steem and Bitshares, two of the most fast blockchain in the world leading in the highest number of daily transactions processed in the industry.
With EOSIO solution, blockchain can now scale into millions of transactions per second with zero transaction fee, support a wide range of business use case and accommodate millions of users that are using the blockchain for free. The main architect of the EOS software is Dan Larimer, who has been described as one of the finest mind in this industry as he invented both Steem and Bitshares, which both use DPOS consensus alogritm which the EOSIO software uses too.

### DPOS: Delegated Proof of Stake
Delegated Proof of Stake is the consensus algorithm used in EOS which was invented by Dan Larimer in 2013 to power Bitshares, his first blockchain project. In DPOS, block producers are elected by network participant who own tokens into a round of 21, each producer gets one block per round, and is rewarded for the validation of incoming messages and production of the block of messages.
Each network participant vote is proportional to their stake, users can also delegate their voting power to another user that can vote on their behalf.
A block released by one producer is validated by the next and the next and so forth; if not validated, it is not built upon. Similar longest-chain mechanics to Bitcoin are followed, and in short order, the producers converge on a longest chain.
Block producers can be voted in or out at any time, so the threat of loss of income and reputation is one of the major incentives against bad behavior. Additionally, slashing conditions can be Page 2 implemented in DPoS rather trivially.

A block that is accepted by a quorum of producers is declared immutable, and the chain of immutable blocks becomes in effect a checkpoint. Like proof of work, producers can censor (ignore) messages, or they can front-run by introducing their own from their superior knowledge of the future. DPOS avoids the tax of mining, releasing that substantial value back to stakeholders. Value from block rewards would be initially captured entirely by the producers. However, because they are elected by the community, they are incentivized to share the rewards by a scheme that producers agree on amongst themselves, and promote to the community

## DCiti Use Cases

There are many use cases and Dapps that can be built on Dciti blockchain by developers with great ideas of how smart services can be integrated with blockchain. The use cases highlighted below are more of the major problems with centralized alternatives that we see decentralized solutions to.

### Decentralized Digital Record
Land Registry and Ownership Access to land title is difficult in the centralized world and very few percentage of the world population is estimated to have this access. Looking at the present centralized land registry system, problems like; badly kept records, record mismanagement and over all, corruption exist in the system. Getting everyone to agree on every stage of a property transaction, and to record it permanently on an incorruptible ledger, is a feat of security, coordination, and trust. DApps that allow for accuracy, security and justice in land registry and ownership can be built on DCiti blockchain. Another huge advantage with this system is that it will be less complicated and expensive system than the centralized one.

### HealthCare Record and Registry
Access to this important record is available to very few people and not many people in the world are able to say exactly where their medical records are located and who has looked at them. With DCiti, health records can be securely stored and managed by residents using their digital identities to see exactly which medical professionals have done the same and when. Any third party who accessed your data without a good reason can be challenged and prosecuted.

### E-Residents and E-Voting

---

### E-Residents and Digital Identity
The internet already helped the world become a digitalized global village and you no longer have to travel to one country before you know what is currently going on in that country. With our blockchain solution anyone can apply and be approved to become a digital resident of a particular city with access to ownership in properties and even possibly own businesses in that city. With E-residents, every public service can be digitalized and accessed by residents through secure digital identities that are provided to every citizen and residents.

### E-Voting
In addition to e-resident, residents can use their Digital identity to vote and access government smart services while records are available and accessible online and citizens control their data. They can choose to restrict access to various information in their personal profiles. E-voting will help residents to better participate in city management decisions and urban planning. Our blockchain solution brings credibility and transparency through an encrypted algorithm to timestamp votes and authenticates voters in real-time, thereby highlighting illegitimate votes straight away.

### Trustless P2P MarketPlace for Ecommerce.
E-commerce is a big major part of smart city and one of the markets that is yet to get disrupted by blockchain technology. A peer to peer form of internet e-commerce Dapp that will permit buyers and sellers to trade with one another without a governing central point of control can be built on DCiti blockchain. Decentralized, trustless, self-organizing, and self-regulating system to facilitate trade.

## BitCiti Smart City Architecture

As briefly mentioned in the introduction part of this white paper, we are going to be building the first decentralized smart city from scratch called BitCiti. We aspire to make BitCiti the first decentralized smart city in the world to fully and practically implement DCiti blockchain solution into its building and architectural system. BitCiti is a combination of ideas and emerging technologies that meet at a point to form a city that will be built with a lot of great features that will differentiate it from the average smart city the world has seen.

### BitCiti Concept Demystified
BitCiti is a decentralized smart city that will be built from scratch on 400 hectares of land aimed to host a community of crypto lovers, technology enthusiast, libertarians and entrepreneurs. In addition to implementing blockchain solutions into the building and architectural system of a smart city that’s been built from scratch, BitCiti will also be a wooden friendly city where emerging wood technology like Cross Laminated Timber will be the primary building material of the city. BitCiti will operate a crypto based economy and have its own issued community cryptocurrency that will serve as the generally accepted native currency of the city. This currency will be used by all residents, businesses, visitors and e-residents when transacting in BitCiti. Land purchases, leasing and every day transactions will all take place using these cryptocurrency.

### Our Belief Of The Future
We have been asked why we want to build a Smart city that uses wood as it primary building material and also being powered exclusively by blockchain technology. The best answers we found to this question is in the 3 envisioned future of smart city and blockchain technology that we foresee and strongly believe in. Below are our beliefs about the future of smart city and blockchain technology as envisioned by us.

1. We envision a future where blockchain technology isn't just something used in smart
contracts and speculation, but something we use in our everyday lives. 
2. We envision a future where sustainable wood technology like CLT completely replaces conventional building materials because of its clear advantages over both steel and concrete.
3. We envision a type of city we would love to live in, so we believe that with
cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, we can build our dream city with few/no limitation and in the process we help shape a better future for the next generation.

### BitCiti Goals and Objectives
Our number one goal is to build BitCiti as a human friendly, technology driven - Smart living environment and voluntary community. The end target is a community built smart city, attracting cryptocurrency lovers, technology enthusiasts, adventurous tourists. And becoming an accelerator hub for the next generation of blockchain businesses and decentralized autonomous communities.

We plan to shape BitCiti to become an environment for cultural advancement and an empowerment ground for a growing population of smart people offered with opportunities to work from home and for any Decentralized Open Source projects, while they rely on their two feet to walk to necessary places within the city so they don’t have to get hooked up in hours of traffic thereby sabotaging their own health.
BitCiti aim to become a lovable and livable city that will receive national and international recognition and become a road-map for future decentralized smart and wooden cities.

Redefining smart city by combining different concepts to produce a great city. Though BitCiti is a smart city, but our goal is a smart city that isn’t just underpinned by advance data and sensor technology only, but focus more on human development and good lifestyle of residents. With Dciti blockchain implementation, we aim to build BitCiti to ensure environmental sustainability, fix social inequality and empower residents with needed resources to build a life they can be proud of.

The overall goal is to build a decentralized and a wooden smart city that’s 60% human centric - 30% technology driven and 10% automobile centric

### Cross Laminated Timber
Cross-laminated timber (CLT) is a large-scale, prefabricated, solid engineered wood panel. Lightweight yet very strong, with superior acoustic, fire, seismic, and thermal performance. CLT is also fast and easy to install, generating almost no waste on-site. CLT offers design flexibility and low environmental impacts. For these reasons, CLT or cross-laminated timber is proving to be a highly advantageous alternative to conventional materials like concrete, masonry, or steel, especially in multi-family and commercial construction.

A CLT panel consists of several layers of kiln-dried lumber boards stacked in alternating directions, bonded with structural adhesives, and pressed to form a solid, straight, rectangular panel. Each layer of boards is oriented perpendicular to adjacent layers and glued on the wide faces of each board, usually in a symmetric way so that the outer layers have the same orientation.

An odd number of layers are most common, but there are configurations with even numbers as well (which are then arranged to give a symmetric configuration). Regular timber is an anisotropic material, meaning that the physical properties change depending on the direction at which the force is applied. By gluing layers of wood at perpendicular angles, the panel is able to achieve better structural rigidity in both directions. It is similar to plywood but with distinctively thicker laminations.

## DCiti and DToken Distribution

There will be 2 billion DCiti token (DToken) total supply for the DCiti Network, which will be widely distributed in a unique way to a wider audience beyond only EOS holders. While DCiti will not have an ICO, BitCiti will have a future unique crowdsale that will be used to raise funds for the building of the crypto smart city. DCiti token is not a security or equity token and its core utility is to serve as a means for effective participation in the DCiti ecosystem.

Unlike what we have seen in the EOS airdrop distribution space so far, DToken distribution intended for community building will be widely airdropped to EOS holder, Bitshares holders, and anyone that register to participate in the token distribution event. While the development part of the token distribution will be airdropped to block producers, Dapp developers and for workers proposal.

### DToken Distribution
  - Community Airdrop 60% -1.2 Billion DToken
  - Development Airdrop 15% - 300 Million DToken
  - Team and Partners 25% - 500 Million DToken

### Airdrop Allocation

#### *Community Airdrop Allocation - 1.2 Billion DToken*
   - EOS Holders 42% - 504 Million DToken
   - Bitshares Holders 38% - 456 Million DToken
   - Registered Participants - 20% - 240 Million DToken

#### Development Airdrop Allocation - 300 Million DToken 
   - Dapp Development 60% - 180 Million DToken
   - Block Producers 40% - 120 Million DToken

### Team and Partners
25% of DToken will be reserved for DCiti core team, and her grassroot partners/investors that provides fund and technical support for the project development. The team fund will be utilized to buy ram in the eos network further hire professionals and expand the growth of the management.
